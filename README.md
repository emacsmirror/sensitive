# sensitive.el --- A dead simple way to load sensitive information

This file is not part of GNU Emacs

## Commentary:

This package is intended to make it dead simple to include
sensitive information in your public .emacs file. More people
publishing their .emacs file is a good thing for the world of Emacs
users and the more facilities people have for hiding the
information they need to load without having to jump through hoops
to load it should make that easier.
